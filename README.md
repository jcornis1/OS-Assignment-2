Here is the summary of the instructions:
 
Banker’s Algorithm for deadlock avoidance.

Considering a system with five processes P0 through P4 and three resources of type A, B, C. Resource type A has 10 instances, B has 5 instances and type C has 7 instances. Suppose at time t0 following snapshot of the system has been taken:
